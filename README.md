# Jdbc::Altibase

This gem bundles the Altibase JDBC jar file for running in JRuby.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile (you should only do this if you are using the gem directly):

```ruby
gem :git => 'https://github.com/leadbaxter/jdbc-altibase.git'
```

Normally, you will probably be using the 'activerecord-jdbcaltibase-adapter' gem, in which case this gem
will automatically be included.

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jdbc-altibase

## Usage

    require 'jdbc/altibase'
